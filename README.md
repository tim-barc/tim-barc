This github account is dedicated to displaying projects I have undertaken.

I am an enthusiastic and driven cybersecurity graduate with a deep passion for learning new things. My journey in cybersecurity is fuelled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a commitment to staying abreast of the latest threats and technologies.

As an avid CTF player on platforms like TryHackMe, CyberDefenders, and LetsDefend, I love the challenge and excitement of solving complex problems and applying my skills in practical scenarios. I also enjoy expanding my cybersecurity knowledge through using platforms like YouTube and exploring the fascinating intersection of AI and cybersecurity. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and its applications in cybersecurity. 

My ultimate aspiration is to serve the people of Australia by contributing to the security interests of this beautiful country. 
As I navigate through my professional journey, I am continuously seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I am excited about the future advancements in cybersecurity and eager to be at the forefront of this dynamic field.
