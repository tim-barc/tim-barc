This github account is dedicated to displaying projects I have undertaken.

I am an enthusiastic and driven cybersecurity student at La Trobe University with a deep passion for learning new things. My journey in cybersecurity is fuelled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a commitment to staying abreast of the latest threats and technologies.

As an avid CTF player on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox, I love the challenge and excitement of solving complex problems and applying my skills in practical scenarios. I also enjoy expanding my cybersecurity knowledge through using platforms like YouTube and exploring the fascinating intersection of AI and cybersecurity. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and its applications in cybersecurity. 

My ultimate aspiration is to serve the people of Australia by contributing to the security interests of this beautiful country, particularly within the Australian Public Service (APS) or the Australian Defence Force (ADF). 
As I navigate through my academic and professional journey, I am continuously seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I am excited about the future advancements in cybersecurity and eager to be at the forefront of this dynamic field.
